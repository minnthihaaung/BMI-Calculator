					"As we watch sun goes down, evening after evening, through the smog across the poisoned waters of our native earth, we must ask ourselves seriously whether whether we really wish some future universial historian on another planet to say about us: With all their genius and with all their skill, they ran out of foresight and air and food and water and ideas. They went on playing politics until their world collapsed around them."
